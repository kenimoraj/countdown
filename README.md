# countdown

British game show "Countdown" presents contestants and viewers with suprisingly sophisticated problems.
This project is an attempt to solve these problems programmatically.

Launch **countdown.py** and choose if you want to solve for a numbers or a letters round, **numbers_round_calc.py** and **letters_round_calc.py** store logic for both, respectively.

## Numbers round

The idea is to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on 6 given numbers to achieve the target number (parentheses can go anywhere one pleases).

This project uses recursive algorithms and combinatorics to arrive at a right answer.

## Letters round

Anagrams. Contestants are given 9 letters (jumbled or random) and the goal is to build the longest possible word.

Once again, this is solved recursively using the wordlist stored in _english.txt_:
